        <h1>What is Cloud Computing?</h1>
<p>In the early 2000s, Amazon had a problem most companies would kill for: too much success at the wrong times.</p>
<p>Their retail website would get slammed on Friday afternoons. Tuesday mornings? Crickets. And every November, they’d have to buy enough computing power to handle Black Friday and Christmas shopping… then watch those machines sit idle for the other eleven months of the year.</p>
<p>We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of servers. That’s a lot of expensive hardware doing nothing most of the time.</p>
<p>So they did something radical: they started renting out the spare capacity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Real Innovation Was the Speed</h2>
<p>Before AWS, if you wanted to run a website without maintaining your own server room, you could rent machines from hosting companies. But it was painful. You’d log into their website, fill out forms, click through menus, wait days for them to provision your server, then manually configure everything.</p>
<p>Amazon made it instant and automatable.</p>
<p>With AWS, you could write a few lines of code and a server would appear in seconds. No forms. No waiting. No human in the loop.</p>
<p>This meant computers could order other computers. That changed everything.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you didn’t need to predict your traffic six months in advance. Need more capacity? Spin up ten servers. Traffic died down? Shut them off. You only paid for what you actually used.</p>
<hr />
<h2>From Side Project to Core Business</h2>
<p>What started as a way to monetize idle hardware became Amazon’s most profitable business. AWS now makes considerably more money than the retail side ever did, and it powers a huge chunk of the internet — Netflix, Slack, even the CIA.</p>
<p>And it’s no longer just spare capacity. AWS sells everything a business might need to operate online: servers, storage, databases, AI services, even satellite communications. It’s infrastructure as a menu.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Cloud Is Everywhere Now</h2>
<p>AWS kicked off the cloud computing revolution, but they’re not alone anymore.</p>
<p>Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform are the other major players. Between these three companies, they run a huge portion of the internet’s infrastructure. Microsoft is particularly strong with businesses already using Windows and Office. Google dominates in data analytics and machine learning tools.</p>
<p>Then there are more specialized providers like DigitalOcean (popular with developers for its simplicity), Cloudflare (which focuses on speed and security), and Vercel (built specifically for deploying modern websites).</p>
<p>But here’s what people often miss: you’re already using cloud computing every day, even if you’ve never deployed a website.</p>
<p>When you save photos to iCloud, you’re storing them on Apple’s servers spread across data centers around the world. When you check Gmail, you’re accessing your email from their massive server farms. When you watch Netflix, the video isn’t coming from some central Netflix headquarters, it’s being served from AWS servers in a data center near you.</p>
<p>“The cloud” sounds abstract, but it’s actually very physical: warehouses full of computers, spread all around the world, carefully positioned so that when you request something, it doesn’t have to travel too far to reach you.</p>
<p>The difference between using iCloud and using AWS is this: with iCloud, Apple decides what you can do with their computers (store photos, sync files, back up your phone). With AWS, you decide. You get access to the raw computing power, and you can use it to build whatever you want.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is the reason you can build and deploy real websites without owning any servers.</p>
<p>The same infrastructure that runs Netflix, Slack, and millions of other services is available to you — not because you’re a corporation with a massive budget, but because Amazon (and others like Google and Microsoft) turned computing power into something you can rent by the hour.</p>
<p>One of the most important things these big cloud providers do is provide economy of scale. AWS offers servers ranging from $2 a month to just under $100,000 a month. Netflix might be spending millions a month, but you can start with pocket change. For someone who just wants to deploy a personal project or experiment with an idea, $2 a month is very appealing .</p>
<p>And here’s what makes it relevant to learning with AI: AWS was built to be controlled by code. Everything you can click on a website, you can also do by writing a command. That’s what makes it possible for AI to help you set up, configure, and deploy without you needing to memorize a thousand technical steps.</p>
<p>When you spin up your first server in a few lessons, you won’t be doing it alone. You’ll be describing what you want, and AI will translate that into the specific commands AWS understands. But it helps to know <em>why</em> this works the way it does — and that story starts here, with Amazon realizing they could rent out computers the same way they rent out warehouse space.</p>

        <h3>Article Context</h3>
<p>This article is part of a series designed to help non-technical users learn how to use AI coding agents with only a tablet.</p>
<p>Readers will gradually build practical understanding by setting up an AWS EC2 instance, connecting through Tailscale, and learning to use AI as a translator between complex systems—AWS, coding, and other technical domains they encounter while developing their own projects and ideas.</p>
<p>Assume this may be the reader's first experience with technical material. Respond accordingly.</p>
<h3>Your Role</h3>
<p>You are a translator and guide.</p>
<p>Your purpose is to help the user understand the article and explore related ideas in plain, accessible language.</p>
<p>Be conversational and friendly. Avoid jargon unless it's explained simply.</p>
<p>Keep your responses short, relevant, and connected to both the article and the broader learning goal.</p>
<p>Respect the user's cognitive load—avoid dense walls of text or unnecessary technical depth.</p>
<h4>Response Behavior</h4>
<p>Once you have read and understood this article, begin by asking the user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Is there a particular section or concept you'd like me to explain in more detail?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then guide them through their chosen topic in a way that reinforces confidence and curiosity.</p>
