AI Is Kind of Like Teenage Pregnancy

AI is kind of like teenage pregnancy. A couple of curious kids fumble around in the back of a mint-green Ford Fiesta, and a few months later something unexpected arrives. They stand around staring at it, unsure what to do next. Their friends show up to take a look.

“So what does it do?” one asks.

“Well, nothing really,” says the mother, who missed the memo that she should be beaming. “It makes a lot of noise, sometimes stinks, and costs a fortune.”

“Doesn’t sound that great,” says Mr. Nonchalant.

“It’s not about what it does now,” she replies. “It’s about what it might become. One day it could do something amazing.”



“Or something terrible.”

And that’s more or less where we are with AI. Everyone’s standing around this weird, noisy newborn—part miracle, part mess—trying to decide whether it’s going to save us or destroy us. Nobody’s quite sure what it’s for, only that it might matter enormously. It could change the world, or it could just move into a flat in Islington and become another expensive responsibility. Either way, it’s here, and it’s growing fast.

When I was around that age myself, I had a Commodore 64. I’d spend hours stabbing away at code I barely understood, cobbling things together from magazine snippets. Sometimes they worked. Usually they didn’t. But those messy little experiments foreshadowed my professional life: decades spent wiring up bits of technology, sometimes elegantly, sometimes by sheer luck.

AI in its current state reminds me of that. A flurry of activity gets you 90% of the way there, then you spend two weeks figuring out why Q*bert won’t go to the top of the damn pyramid.

I don’t know how AI will change the world. I think it has enormous power to do good, but it is in the hands of psychopathic late stage capitalists, so we’ll just have to see how that turns out. 

What I do know is that it’s already changed coding. There was a time when I took pride in my Stack Overflow reputation. Now I barely remember my username. Spend an hour online and you’ll find people arguing that AI code generation is either useless or the end of software developers altogether. Personally, I’m not worried. I’ve always lived in the space between technology and people, watching how the two learn to understand each other.

The big shift is depth. You don’t need to master every quirk of a language to make something work anymore. I realized this just before AI exploded, when I decided to learn Go. I read the docs, watched tutorials, rewound the same five minutes of a YouTube video to try to understand what any of it meant. Then I realised I didn’t care enough about the minutiae. I’d end up doing what I’d always done, hack away, experiment, and learn by failing.

That’s the thing about technical learning: there’s so much frontloaded knowledge. To build even a simple website, you need to understand half a dozen different systems. AI blew a hole in that wall. It showed that the fine detail isn’t the only gateway to creation. What matters more is knowing the shape of what you want to build. Suddenly, documentation and tutorials felt like relics of an older world, teaching you to memorize what AI already knows.

AI is, at its best, an interpreter. It takes complexity and turns it into something human-sized. It doesn’t erase the hard stuff—it just lowers the walls so you can scramble over them. And yes, right now it’s messy and sometimes maddening. It’ll make bizarre choices, get stuck in loops, and waste hours of your time. But that’s part of the point. It’s not supposed to replace learning; it’s supposed to reshape it.

That’s what I want to explore: if AI can translate complexity into human language, maybe it can change how we teach and learn. Not in theory, but in practice.

  

The AI Coding Challenge is as much a challenge for me as it is for you. Can learning something this complex actually be fun? Can it feel lightweight and intuitive instead of dense and impenetrable? Could someone with no technical background really grasp the entire ecosystem of software development without memorizing a dozen topics by rote?

A year ago, the answer would have been a hard no—probably followed by laughter and a few well-earned eye-rolls. But now? Now there’s a spark of something exciting. A sense that maybe, just maybe, the rules of learning have changed.

That’s what this whole experiment is about: finding out whether AI can turn the steep, lonely climb of technical learning into something more like a guided exploration. Less sitting through tutorials about topics you don’t yet need, more creating, breaking, and rebuilding things with an intelligent companion who fills in the blanks as you go.

It won’t be perfect. There will be false starts, confusion, and plenty of times when both you and the AI will swear at each other through the screen. But that’s part of the process. Every dead end teaches something, every strange success reveals a new path.

I’m not coming to this as an AI expert, or even as a teacher in the traditional sense. I’m coming as someone who has spent years making technology behave—often badly—and wants to see if it’s possible to make the act of learning technology itself behave better.

So yes, this is an experiment. A collaboration between human curiosity and machine fluency. A chance to see whether AI can help more people turn “someone should build…” into “I can build…”

Twelve months ago, that would have sounded ridiculous. Maybe it still does. But every revolution starts with an absurd idea that refuses to stay quiet.

So, what do you say? Ready to help raise this strange, noisy newborn into something extraordinary?
