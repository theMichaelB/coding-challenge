From Laziness to Learning: How AI Changes the Way We Learn to Build

My career started the same way as thousands of others: on a helpdesk, fixing other people’s mistakes. I was decent at it, mostly because I hated doing things twice. Laziness, it turns out, is an underrated driver of innovation. Every time something broke, I automated the fix. If people broke it again, I automated them out of the loop entirely.

Eventually I was managing a few thousand offshore support staff, trying to make sure they were vaguely competent at fixing things. It was a long exercise in discovering that herding people pays worse than automating their work. So I shifted focus – from fixing people to (trying to) fixing the processes they broke.

For a while, I was designing automation systems. That put me in too many meetings with people who had grand ideas and no clue how computers actually functioned. Around that time, the term “DevOps” appeared, which meant I could keep automating things and get management’s blessing to yell at people for doing them manually.

How I Learned to Learn

My learning path was unglamorous: Windows, Linux, Unix, networking, scripting, coding. The usual grind. I was never one of those people who could read a book on a topic and absorb it. I’d read the same page twenty times and still have no clue what I’d just read. But drop me into a broken system with that same book nearby, and I could make it work.

That approach carried me for years. When someone asked me a question I didn’t know, my standard answer was, “I have absolutely no clue – give me half an hour.” Then I’d dig until I found the answer. Sometimes it was from experience, sometimes from knowing who to ask, sometimes from the internet. My skill wasn’t knowing things; it was knowing how to find them.

For this reason, programming never really appealed to me. The coding I learned was functional – short scripts that did things directly and gave instant results. Programming felt like the opposite: too much front-loaded knowledge, too many layers to wade through before you got to anything useful. There is just too much abstraction in places I don’t care about. When “vibe coding” came along, it finally bridged that gap. I didn’t need to memorise every syntax rule – I could jump straight into solving problems, designing systems, and connecting the parts that actually mattered.

The Shift: AI and Learning on Demand

AI flipped something fundamental about how we learn. I no longer needed to memorize the entire contents of a book I’d forget anyway. I could pull up the exact concept I needed at the exact moment I needed it. That changes the idea of learning from front-loading knowledge to learning in motion.

Imagine someone trying to build a simple browser-based to-do app. They start with enthusiasm, make fast progress, hit some bugs, and then the AI starts hallucinating solutions. That’s the point where structured learning should kick in – short, targeted lessons that explain how to separate logic, structure projects, and debug effectively. It’s learning through doing, not reading about doing.

Real problems. Real solutions. No filler.

The Conversation as a Classroom

What makes this even more powerful is how AI resurrects something ancient – the Socratic method. Learning becomes a dialogue again. You ask, it challenges, you refine your understanding in real time. It’s not a textbook or a lecture; it’s an intelligent back-and-forth that shapes how you think.

This isn’t theoretical. I’m building a system around that idea – guiding complete beginners through creating and deploying real software, step by step. Each stage combines:

A video showing what’s happening.

An article explaining the high-level concepts.

A prompt they can drop into their AI tool of choice to guide and verify their understanding.

The goal is simple: remove the wall between learning and doing. With AI as a conversational partner, learning becomes immediate, personal, and driven by the work itself.

So this is the plan, now all I’ve got to do is get comfortable talking to myself for a video…
